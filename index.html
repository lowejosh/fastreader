Our eyes don't move smoothly across a page, they make discrete jumps from word to word. Even while your eyes are fixated on a single word, your brain is still gathering preliminary information about surrounding words. You are actually amazing, and there's much more to it. That is why I developed this tool, I want to use real research and word recognition science to push our brains to the speed reading limit.
